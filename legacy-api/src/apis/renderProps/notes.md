render props pattern in React can be tricky to grasp at first. Here's a simple trick to remember it, followed by an example:

Trick to remember:
Think of render props as **"Component sharing" through functions**. Instead of passing static data as props, you're passing a function that returns JSX.

Let me demonstrate this with a simple example:



```jsx
import React from 'react';

// This is our component that uses render props
const MouseTracker = ({ render }) => {
  const [mousePosition, setMousePosition] = React.useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

  const handleMouseMove = (event) => {
    setMousePosition({
      x: event.clientX,
      y: event.clientY
    });
  };

  return (
    <div style={{ height: '100vh' }} onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}>
      {/* passing dynamic props */}
      {render(mousePosition)}
    </div>
  );
};

// This is how we use the MouseTracker component
const App = () => {
  return (
    <MouseTracker
      render={({ x, y }) => (
        <h1>The mouse position is ({x}, {y})</h1>
      )}
    />
  );
};

export default App;

```

In this example:

1. `MouseTracker` is a component that tracks the mouse position.
2. Instead of rendering its own UI, it accepts a `render` prop, which is a function.
3. This `render` function gets called with the current mouse position.
4. In the `App` component, we use `MouseTracker` and provide a function to the `render` prop. This function defines what should be rendered.

The key idea is that `MouseTracker` manages the state (mouse position) and provides it to whatever UI we want to render. This makes `MouseTracker` very flexible and reusable.

Would you like me to explain any part of this code in more detail?
